Current methods for teaching regional anaesthesia (RA) do not consider patient-specific anatomy
and therefore have limited capabilities. Developing a virtual reality based simulator and assistant
device for training and performing RA requires virtual physiological human (VPH) models.
Commercial models such as Zygote and Anatomium are insufficient due to inconsistency, lack of
anatomical correctness, and missing structures like the fascia. We collected a variety of imaging data
including individual computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to build a VPH model
that is composed of anatomical structures, physical properties such as needle resistance, and
functional features (vessel bending in pulse frequency). The model is applied for RA simulation and
