Recent advances in tactile rendering span, among
others, wearable cutaneous interfaces, tactile rendering algorithms,
or nonlinear soft skin models. However, the adoption
of these advances for multi-finger tactile rendering of dexterous
grasping and manipulation is hampered by the computational
cost incurred with nonlinear skin models when applied to the
full hand. We have observed that classic constrained dynamics
solvers, typically designed for contact mechanics, fail to perform
efficiently on deformation constraints of nonlinear skin models.
In this paper, we propose a novel constrained dynamics solver
designed to perform well with highly nonlinear deformation
constraints. In practice, we achieve more than 10x speed-up
over previous approaches, and as a result we enable multifinger
tactile rendering of manipulation actions that capture
the nonlinearity of skin.
