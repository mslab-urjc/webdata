Technological advances enable the capture and management of complex data sets that
need to be correctly understood. Visualisation techniques can help in complex data analysis and
exploration, but sometimes the visual channel is not enough, or it is not always available. Some
authors propose using the haptic channel to reinforce or substitute the visual sense, but the limited
human haptic short-term memory still poses a challenge. We present the haptic tuning fork, a reference signal displayed before the haptic information for increasing the discriminability of haptic
icons. With this reference, the user does not depend only on short-term memory. We have decided to
evaluate the usefulness of the haptic tuning fork in impedance kinesthetic devices as these are the
most common. Furthermore, since the renderable signal ranges are device-dependent, we introduce
a methodology to select a discriminable set of signals called the haptic scale. Both the haptic tuning
fork and the haptic scale proved their usefulness in the performed experiments regarding haptic
stimuli varying in frequency
