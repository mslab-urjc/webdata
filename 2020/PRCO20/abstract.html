To deploy yarn-level cloth simulations in production environments, it is paramount to design very efficient implementations, which mitigate the cost of the extremely high resolution. To this end, nodal discretizations aligned with the regularity of the fabric structure provide an optimal setting for efficient GPU implementations. However, nodal discretizations complicate the design of robust and controllable bending. In this paper, we address this challenge, and propose a model of bending that is both robust and controllable, and employs only nodal degrees of freedom. We extract information of yarn and fabric orientation implicitly from the nodal degrees of freedom, with no need to augment the model explicitly. But most importantly, and unlike previous formulations that use implicit orientations, the computation of bending forces bears no overhead with respect to other nodal forces such as stretch. This is possible by tracking optimal orientations efficiently. We demonstrate the impact of our bending model in examples with controllable anisotropy, as well as ironing, wrinkling, and plasticity.
