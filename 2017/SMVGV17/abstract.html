We present an Open-source library called gVirtualXRay to simulate realistic X-ray images in realtime. It implements the
attenuation law (also called Beer-Lambert) on GPU. It takes into account the polychromatism of the beam spectra as well as the
finite size of X-ray tubes. The library is written in C++ using modern OpenGL. It is fully portable and works on most common
desktop/laptop computers. It has been tested on MS Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It supports a wide range of windowing
solutions, such as FLTK, GLUT, GLFW3, Qt4, and Qt5. The library also offers realistic visual rendering of anatomical
structures, including bones, liver, diaphragm and lungs. The accuracy of the X-ray images produced by gVirtualXRay’s
implementation has been validated using Geant4, a well established state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulation toolkit developed
by CERN. gVirtualXRay can be used in a wide range of applications where fast and accurate X-ray simulations from polygon
meshes are needed, e.g. medical simulators for training purposes, simulation of tomography data acquisition with patient
motion to include artefacts in reconstructed CT images, and deformable registration. Our application example package includes
real-time respiration and X-ray simulation, CT acquisition and reconstruction, and iso-surfacing of implicit functions using
