The 3DTI Toolkit is a standard C++ library for audio spatialisation
and simulation using loudspeakers or headphones developed within
the 3D Tune-In (3DTI) project (http://www.3d-tune-in.eu), which
aims at using 3D sound and simulating hearing loss and hearing
aids within virtual environments and games. The Toolkit allows the
design and rendering of highly realistic and immersive 3D audio,
and the simulation of virtual hearing aid devices and of different
typologies of hearing loss. The library includes a real-time 3D
binaural audio renderer offering full 3D spatialization based on
efficient Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) convolution,
including smooth interpolation among impulse responses,
customization of listener head radius and specific simulation of fardistance
and near-field effects. In addition, spatial reverberation is
simulated in real time using a uniformly partitioned convolution
with Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIRs) employing a
virtual Ambisonic approach. The 3D Tune-In Toolkit includes also
a loudspeaker-based spatialiser implemented using Ambisonic
encoding/decoding. This poster presents a brief overview of the
main features of the Toolkit, which is released open-source under
GPL v3 license (the code is available in GitHub
https://github.com/3DTune-In/3dti_AudioToolkit).
