During the lifecycle of many industrial products, different services are applied over the different parts or sub-assemblies of the product geometry, from design and validation tests to maintenance operations.
After a services is run, a decision-making process usually starts from the analysis of the service results.
This paper presents a tool for analysis and decision-making based on service results linked to the geometry of complex products organized in a hierarchy of sub-assemblies.
The tool is based in the use of separate models for the product, the services and the analysis of results, and the generation of different views of the models including a virtual representation of the product with overlapped service result information.
The virtual representation of the product consists in a render of a 3D scan of the product where techniques to handle visual occlusion between parts are appli3ed. 
An application case is presented for collaborative discussion of inspection results of a power plant steam turbine.
